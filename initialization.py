        - network_enhancement: True or False; if True: we use the localized network
        (adoubly stochastic matrix) and Symmetric Network Enhancement (SNE); 
        if False: we use the probability matrix and Directed Network Enhancement (DNE)

        - gamma_damping: float between 0 and 1, controls forgetting/damping
        of h-values

        - beta_h: float >=0, probabilities are proportional to
        exp(beta_h*h_value). is used for converting h-values to probabilities
        during training and to generate the Network enhancement input

        - beta_t:  float >=0, controls agentâ€™s function in a trial at test phase (derived relation)

        - 0 < K <= 1 is the parameter for symmetry relation. K=1 means that
        the relations are bidirectional and network is symmetric at the end of 
        the training phase.
